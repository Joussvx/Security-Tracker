## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
-   `npm` (usually comes with Node.js)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account and project.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/security-tracker.git
    cd security-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your Supabase environment:**
    -   Create a new project on [Supabase](https://app.supabase.io).
    -   In your Supabase project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables and policies.
    -   (Optional) Run the contents of `supabase/seed.sql` to seed your database with initial shift data.

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    -   Find your project's **URL** and **anon key** in your Supabase project settings (API section).
    -   Add them to your `.env.local` file:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## üìú Available Scripts
